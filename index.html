								<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I have picked up interest in IT because it provides a very wide range of job opportunities in this current era of technology. People with IT skill and knowledge are needed by most of the modern businesses nowadays, in example is digital marketing.  It is a well-rounded course, as it can also help me grow better in many areas as I experience in working with it, in example I can learn about how to advertise a business by helping a business to just make a website. I was enlightened to start this course during my high school summer break, when I realize that a simple website on the internet can peak my interest in buying an item. At that moment, I also realize an IT person’s vast potential. My friends also encouraged me on taking this course, since they are taking a business course and they realize that in the future we may cross paths again and work together.</a>.</p>
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT because I heard of its reputation on the IT major and Social Science major.  I am planning to take a Business elective during my study in RMIT.  RMIT also have a strong student community, which I can learn from for I am going to need the skills to work in teams and have a diverse community for my future field of work. These connections will benefit me as soon in the future, paths can cross again, and partnership in work may be formed.<p>
								<p>I expect that I gain many experiences during my time in Melbourne, along with the knowledge from RMIT.  I expect not only to learn the theory, but also practical skills, such as working in teams, time management, and keeping composure during pressure. These skills that will develop during my studies here will be used in the future career endeavors. I also wanted to develop my personal IT skills and be able to reap out the results that will soon grow after time and effort I have put in.<p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My passion is on IT and helping those in need. I believe that by helping those in need, I can attain a sense of satisfaction. I believe that the highest satisfaction level is when you help others voluntarily without asking for reward. To this reason is why I seek to help those in need with a knowledge that not all people can attain. I strive to bring out the best in what I learned by creating a program that is used to develop robots that can help the elderly in order for them to enjoy their retirement. </p>
								<p>I have peak interest into starting this project in the mere future, because I wanted to simply help an elderly, as I believe that an elderly was once a young and energetic person that made an impact in someone’s lives. It is only right that I gave back on their kindness that they have seeded once. My home country, Indonesia is a developing country, a country that is still undergoing quiet and internal battles amongst themselves. Not all people will reap out the kindness that has been seeded by the small portion of this country, however I would like to be one of those that start and change the mindset of my country, as my country will always have hope. This is my motivation in pursuing my current major and my future innovation. I want to help and make my country better and gain myself a sense of satisfaction by helping the elderly. I believe that this is a win-win solution for me and my country.</p>
								<p>I would like to make a machine that helps elderly do chores, in example is washing the dishes, watering the flowers, cleaning up the garden, cooking their dinner, etc. This robot assistant that will help the elderly will also be able to talk back to the elderly in simple languages that they can understand. With an artificial intelligence that is going to be created by a group of elderly caretakers, I believe that the interface should be created simpler than the current user interface that is used in the common CPU, in example Windows 10. According to personal experience, my grandmother finds it hard and complicated to learn to operate the Windows 10.  By using this A.I, I want it to be possible to surf up the internet and giving out results, simplify them into words and actions that can be understood by elders. In example is the robot could use a talk-back function, while acting out and explaining on how to use the vacuum cleaner to an elder that asked the robot. I came up with this idea in reference to the current technology, Google Home, however I wanted to simplify and integrate its way of giving out results. Another feature that I can include is this robot will be able to get a special license to drive a car or a bike, to help the elderly get groceries and needs. I would also include the knowledge of a nursing home chef and put it in the database, so that the robot can cook according to the special needs and fulfill the nutrition of the elders. This robot will also be able to have a sensor that detects projectiles and objects within 500 meter radius. This is to help the elders when crossing the road, park the car, etc. Lastly, the feature that I believe would be most essential, is the defense against hostiles feature. When this robot senses hostility within the radius, the robot will prioritize in defending the elderly by self-defense, or sacrificing the robot in certain occasions. An example is when a car is speeding, and a high probability of the car colliding with the elderly is calculated, the robot will then push the elderly to the side with a non-excessive force and take in the place of impact instead.<p>
								<p>For the tools and technologies needed, of course we will need some software, hardware, and equipments. First of all, for the software, of course we will need a robotic software. For the hardware, we will need to have a lot type of hardwares, such as CPU(Central Processing Unit), RAM(Random Access Memory), System Storage, and many more because robot is a complex machine. Lastly, for the equipments or tools, we definitely will need some mechanical equipments/tools, such as cut off wheel, screws, plier, screwdriver, drill, wrench, hammer, paint, weld, and so much more. We will also need some electrical tools for building the robot.<p>
								<p>There are so many skills required to build a robot, even just a simple one. And for this kind of robot, I think the skills required are of course related to the tools and technoloiges that used to build the robot. First of all, the software skill. How can we make the robot work with the software? Of course by using a program, and there are so many programming language that is usually used for robotic software, and the most common one is C++. And the next skill needed is the skill to build and assemble the hardwares into one single robot. The last one is the skill to use the tools properly.<p>
								<p>If this project is successful, 18 million elders in my country will have a higher chance of longevity, and I think that I can gain more and more investors and sponsor in this project. I believe that my country will start spreading more kindness and become more stable, leading to increase in GDP, making my country a developed one. It would be a win-win for the country and the elders in Indonesia. As for myself, I gain a high tier satisfaction that can’t be bought with money.<p>
